After conquering my first cartwheel in 2024, I was ready for a new challenge. Enter 2025, when my best friend Camila proposed an exciting goal - completing a 5K together, along with a few other personal milestones.

## The Project

This challenge inspired me to create a comprehensive 5K Resolution tracking dashboard. While I typically rely on calculated fields, I expanded my practiced other elements of my toolkit by exploring new Google Sheets formulas. This approach allows for easier updates and centralized data management.

The dashboard is designed for Camila and I - for both encouragement and competition.
