After conquering my first cartwheel in 2024, I was ready for a new challenge. Enter 2025, when my best friend Camila proposed an exciting goal - completing a 5K together, along with a few other personal milestones.

## The Project

This challenge inspired me to create a comprehensive tracking dashboard. While I typically rely on calculated fields, I decided to expand my technical toolkit by exploring new Google Sheets formulas. This approach allows for easier updates and centralized data management.

The dashboard is designed for both Camila and me, fostering a spirit of friendly competition and mutual encouragement as we progress toward our goals.
